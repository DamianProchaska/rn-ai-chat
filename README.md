## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- React Native development environment set up ([React Native Environment Setup Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup))
- Xcode (for iOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/DamianProchaska/rn-ai-chat.git

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Run the app on your device:
   npm run ios
   npm run android

### Backend Server

The application is configured to connect with a backend server hosted on Railway. The server URL is hardcoded in the application for simplicity. You don't need to set up the backend locally as it's already deployed and running.

Backend repository: https://github.com/DamianProchaska/ai-chat-api

> **Note:** The backend server is maintained in a separate repository and is already deployed on Railway. All necessary endpoints are preconfigured in the application, so no additional setup is required.
